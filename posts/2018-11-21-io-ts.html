<p><em>This post assumes familiarity with TypeScript.</em></p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>One of the caveats of TypeScript is the ability for the compile-time type of a value to not match the run-time value. This is especially troublesome for values coming in from application boundaries (user input, external services, etc). Validating inputs at application boundaries is a good idea, to the point of being a programming truism - that said there are better and worse ways to do so. <a href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts">io-ts</a> is one of the better ways.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Consider the following type:</p>
<pre class="typescript"><code>interface myInterface {
   name: string,
   value: number
}</code></pre>
<p>This is fairly easy to validate with a little bit of code. <em>(Please note I’m taking liberties and assuming !!value returns true for values that are not null or undefined - I’m ignoring weird falsiness behavior out of expediency in explanation over correctness)</em></p>
<pre class="typescript"><code>const validateMyInterface = (maybeMyInterface) =&gt;
    !!maybeMyInterface
    &amp;&amp; !!maybeMyInterface.name
    &amp;&amp; maybeMyInterface.name instanceOf string
    &amp;&amp; !!maybeMyInterface.value
    &amp;&amp; maybeMyInterface.value instanceOf Number</code></pre>
<p>That’s a fair bit of typing and some of these pieces look reusable, so maybe we break these down into smaller pieces and build up from there.</p>
<pre class="typescript"><code>const validateExists = (maybeExists) =&gt;
    maybeExists !== null
    &amp;&amp; maybeExists !== undefined,
  validateString = (maybeString) =&gt;
    validateExists(maybeString)
    &amp;&amp; maybeString instanceOf string,
  validateNumber = (maybeNumber) =&gt;
    validateExists(maybeNumber)
    &amp;&amp; maybeNumber instanceOf Number,
  validateMyInterface = (maybeMyInterface) =&gt;
    validateExists(maybeMyInterface)
    &amp;&amp; validateString(maybeMyInterface.name)
    &amp;&amp; validateNumber(maybeMyInterface.value);</code></pre>
<p>That’s nice, but surely somebody else has already done a lot of this legwork - it’s generic enough to assume this is a solved problem. Perhaps we’re wasting effort here - but that’s not the most troubling problem. What concerns me most is keeping the validator in sync with the actual type. If <code>myInterface</code> is updated, I will need to remember to update <code>validateMyInterface</code> as well. This means this solution hasn’t completely solved the problem of the compile-time type and the run-time value being different.</p>
<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts/blob/master/src/index.ts">io-ts</a> is the prior work to solve validating run-time values against compile time types. Even better, it can be used in a way that completely avoids the type and validator drifting apart.</p>
<p>Once again, let’s write a validator for <code>myInterface</code>.</p>
<pre class="typescript"><code>import * as t from 'io-ts'

const myInterfaceValidator = t.interface({
  name: t.string,
  value: t.number
});</code></pre>
<p>That looks strikingly similar to the interface declaration. Here it is again so we can see them side by side:</p>
<pre class="typescript"><code>interface myInterface {
  name: string
  value: number
}</code></pre>
<p>It’s still possible for the validator to drift from the type definition though. io-ts is savvy enough to give us a way to allow us to generate both the validator and the type from the same code.</p>
<pre class="typescript"><code>interface myInterface extends t.TypeOf&lt;typeof myInterfaceValidator&gt; {}</code></pre>
<p>Just like that, validator and type definition are created at once and can never drift apart.</p>
<h2 id="usage-example">Usage Example</h2>
<pre class="typescript"><code>import * as t from 'io-ts'
import {ThrowReporter} from 'io-ts/lib/ThrowReporter'

const tMyInterface = t.interface({
    name: t.string,
    value: t.number
});

export interface MyInterface extends t.TypeOf&lt;typeof tMyInterface&gt; {}

const maybeMyInterface = {},
    validationResult = tMyInterface.decode(maybeMyInterface);

//throws an exception if validation doesn't pass
ThrowReporter.report(validationResult);

console.log(validationResult.value);</code></pre>
<p><code>validationResult</code> is an <code>Either</code> value, and does not strictly need to be passed through a Reporter. It is possible to inspect the result, using <code>isLeft()</code> and <code>isRight()</code> functions and take whatever action is appropriate for the use case.</p>
